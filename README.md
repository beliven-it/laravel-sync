3. Make the file executable by running `chmod +x laravel-sync`.

### Downloading the file

1. Download the `laravel-sync` file.
2. Copy the file to the root of your Laravel project.
3. Make the file executable by running `chmod +x laravel-sync`.

### Copying the content

1. Create a new file called `laravel-sync` in the root of your Laravel project.
2. Copy the content of the `laravel-sync` file from the repository to the new file.
3. Make the file executable by running `chmod +x laravel-sync`.

You can also move the file to a directory that is in your `$PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`.

```bash
sudo mv laravel-sync /usr/local/bin

## üõ† Configuration

The script uses the `.env` file as configuration.

Make sure to add the following variable to the `.env` file:

```bash
echo "SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_ALLOWED='staging production'" >> .env
```

If you have a different environment, you can add it to the `SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_ALLOWED` variable.

```bash
# For example if you have staging, uat and production environments
echo "SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_ALLOWED='staging uat production'" >> .env
```

At the first run:

```bash

./laravel-sync config

```

This command create inside the `.env` the env needed to use the script. An example of the `.env` file is:

```bash
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_ALLOWED="staging production"

# Folders to download / upload
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_ASSETS="storage/statamic/glide/containers content"

# Local environment
# Database environment
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL_DB_HOST="${DB_HOST}"
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL_DB_PORT="${DB_PORT}"
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL_DB_USERNAME="${DB_USERNAME}"
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL_DB_PASSWORD=""
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL_DB_DATABASE="${DB_DATABASE}"
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL_DB_CONNECTION="${DB_CONNECTION}"

# Host environment for local is not needed

# Staging environment
# # Database environment
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_STAGING_DB_HOSTNAME=
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_STAGING_DB_PORT=
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_STAGING_DB_PASSWORD=
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_STAGING_DB_USERNAME=

SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_STAGING_DB_CONNECTION=

# Host environment
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_STAGING_HOST_USER=
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_STAGING_HOST_HOSTNAME=
