## üõ† Configuration

The script uses the `.env` file as configuration.

Make sure to add the following variable to the `.env` file:

```bash
echo "SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_ALLOWED='staging production'" >> .env
```

If you have a different environment, you can add it to the `SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_ALLOWED` variable.

```bash
# For example if you have staging, uat and production environments
echo "SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_ALLOWED='staging uat production'" >> .env
```

At the first run:

```bash

./laravel-sync config

```

This command create inside the `.env` the env needed to use the script. An example of the `.env` file is:

```bash
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_ALLOWED="staging production"

# Folders to download / upload
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_ASSETS="storage/statamic/glide/containers content"

# Local environment
# Database environment
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL_DB_HOST="${DB_HOST}"
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL_DB_PORT="${DB_PORT}"
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL_DB_USERNAME="${DB_USERNAME}"
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL_DB_PASSWORD="${DB_PASSWORD}"
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL_DB_DATABASE="${DB_DATABASE}"
SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_LOCAL_DB_CONNECTION="${DB_CONNECTION}"

# Host environment for local is not needed

# Staging environment
# # Database environment

### How to pull the remote environment to a local environment that use Sail?

You can use the `--use-docker` option to use Docker to pull the database. For example:

```bash
./laravel-sync pull staging --use-docker

# ... or using the short flag version

./laravel-sync pull staging -k
```

### How can avoid to run SSH command with plain text password?

You can edit the `.env` file and add set the: `SYNC_ENVIRONMENT_<environment_choosed>_DB_PASSWORD` to empty.

When you launch the commands, the script will ask you to insert the password.
